# volcanolatsandlongs
This markdown file describes the creation of an interactive scatter plot created with plotly that does some exploratory data analsysis on whether there is a correspondance between global position and number of active volcanos. The results suggest that active Volcanos are more common in the northern hemisphere (above the equator at lattitude = 0).
